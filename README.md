# React Native Reponsive UI

Building reponsive UIs in React Native.

## What about existing packages?

* [react-native-responsive](https://github.com/adbayb/react-native-responsive): This library provides interesting APIs but it doesn't listen to changes in the app window.
This is problematic when changing the orientation of the device or when splitting screens.

* [react-native-responsive-styles](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-native-responsive-styles): This is a great library but it contains native depencies which prevents you to use it with expo for instance.

npm install react-native-responsive-ui --save
