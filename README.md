# React Native Reponsive UI

Building reponsive UIs in React Native.

## What about the react-native-responsive package?
While [react-native-responsive](https://github.com/adbayb/react-native-responsive) provides the right API, it doesn't listen to changes in the app window.
This is problematic when changing the orientation of the device or when splitting screens.

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-native-responsive-ui --save
```

## Usage

### Responsive Component

### Media Queries
